<p>Hello and welcome to my personal blog! I’m Shiva Maruth Alapati, and I’m excited to have you here. As a Software Development Engineer at AWS SageMaker AI, I wanted to create a space to share insights from my journey building systems that make AI more scalable, reliable, and accessible.</p>

<h2 id="who-am-i">Who Am I?</h2>

<p>I’m currently focused on making fine-tuning large language models scalable and cost-effective at AWS SageMaker AI. My work involves building software for fine-tuning foundation models and evaluating their performance at scale, helping customers adapt large language and vision models efficiently.</p>

<p>Before this, I worked on SageMaker HyperPod, improving large-scale distributed model training, and started my AWS journey on the Lambda team, where I shipped services that improved reliability and reduced costs at massive scale.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-can-expect">What You Can Expect</h2>

<p>This blog will be a place where I share:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Technical deep dives</strong> into building scalable AI systems</li>
  <li><strong>Lessons learned</strong> from working with LLMs and distributed training</li>
  <li><strong>Architecture insights</strong> from AWS services and infrastructure design</li>
  <li><strong>Performance optimization</strong> techniques for ML workloads</li>
  <li><strong>Industry observations</strong> on the evolving AI/ML landscape</li>
  <li><strong>Career reflections</strong> on growing in the field of AI engineering</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-i-started-this-blog">Why I Started This Blog</h2>

<p>The field of AI engineering is moving incredibly fast, and I’ve learned so much from the community sharing their experiences. This blog serves as:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A way to give back to the community that has taught me so much</li>
  <li>A platform to share lessons from working on AI systems at scale</li>
  <li>A space to explore ideas and connect with fellow engineers</li>
  <li>A personal knowledge base for documenting insights and growth</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>I have several exciting posts planned for the coming weeks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deep dive into fine-tuning strategies for large language models</li>
  <li>Lessons learned from optimizing distributed training workloads</li>
  <li>Cost optimization techniques for ML infrastructure</li>
  <li>Thoughts on the future of AI development tools</li>
  <li>Behind-the-scenes insights from working on AWS AI services</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="connect-with-me">Connect With Me</h2>

<p>I’d love to hear from you! Feel free to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Subscribe to my <a href="/newsletters/">newsletter</a> for regular updates on AI/ML trends</li>
  <li>Reach out via <a href="mailto:shivamaruth.alapati@gmail.com">email</a> if you have questions or topic suggestions</li>
  <li>Connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shiva-maruth-alapati/">LinkedIn</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope you’ll join me on this journey of exploring the exciting world of scalable AI systems!</p>
