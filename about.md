Welcome to my personal website! I'm glad you're here.

## Who I Am

I'm a Software Development Engineer at AWS SageMaker AI, where I focus on building systems to make fine-tuning large language models scalable, reliable, and cost-effective. Based in Sunnyvale, California, I'm passionate about the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence.

## What You'll Find Here

This site is my digital home where I share:

- **Blog Posts**: My thoughts on software engineering, machine learning, and building systems at scale
- **Newsletter**: Regular updates on AI/ML trends, engineering insights, and curated content
- **Projects**: Deep dives into the systems and technologies I'm working with

## My Story

Currently, I'm focused on software for fine-tuning foundation models and evaluating performance at scale, helping customers adapt large language and vision models efficiently. Previously, I worked on SageMaker HyperPod, where I contributed to improving large-scale distributed model training.

My journey at AWS began with the Lambda team, where I designed and shipped services that improved reliability, reduced costs, and automated operations at scale. Some highlights include reducing data sync from hours to minutes, automating new region expansion, and reducing cold starts for provisioned concurrency customers.

I continue my learning through Stanford Continuing Studies and hold a degree from Virginia Tech. I'm always excited about new challenges in scalable AI systems and the evolving landscape of machine learning infrastructure.
