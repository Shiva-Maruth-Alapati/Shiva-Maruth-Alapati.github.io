## Who I Am

I'm a Software Development Engineer at AWS SageMaker AI, where I focus on building systems to make fine-tuning large language models scalable, reliable, and cost-effective. 
I'm based in Sunnyvale, California. 

Right now, I'm passionate about the product space, I trying to learn a good product sense.

## My Story

Currently at SageMaker AI I'm focused on building software for fine-tuning and evaluation of foundation models. Previously, I worked on SageMaker HyperPod, where I contributed to improving customer experience with managing large clusters.

My journey at AWS began with the Lambda team, where I worked on improving Lambda's backend infra. I have learned a quite a bit about building large scale distributed systems.

## Social
I'm away from other social media outlets like Instagram and SnapChat, probably one of the best decision in recent times. I highly recommend to get out of social media and spend some time reading a book or going to your local park.
