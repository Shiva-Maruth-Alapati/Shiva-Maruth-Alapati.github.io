# Building Scalable AI: Welcome to My Blog!

Hello and welcome to my personal blog! I'm Shiva Maruth Alapati, and I'm excited to have you here. As a Software Development Engineer at AWS SageMaker AI, I wanted to create a space to share insights from my journey building systems that make AI more scalable, reliable, and accessible.

## Who Am I?

I'm currently focused on making fine-tuning large language models scalable and cost-effective at AWS SageMaker AI. My work involves building software for fine-tuning foundation models and evaluating their performance at scale, helping customers adapt large language and vision models efficiently.

Before this, I worked on SageMaker HyperPod, improving large-scale distributed model training, and started my AWS journey on the Lambda team, where I shipped services that improved reliability and reduced costs at massive scale.

## What You Can Expect

This blog will be a place where I share:

- **Technical deep dives** into building scalable AI systems
- **Lessons learned** from working with LLMs and distributed training
- **Architecture insights** from AWS services and infrastructure design
- **Performance optimization** techniques for ML workloads
- **Industry observations** on the evolving AI/ML landscape
- **Career reflections** on growing in the field of AI engineering

## Why I Started This Blog

The field of AI engineering is moving incredibly fast, and I've learned so much from the community sharing their experiences. This blog serves as:

1. A way to give back to the community that has taught me so much
2. A platform to share lessons from working on AI systems at scale
3. A space to explore ideas and connect with fellow engineers
4. A personal knowledge base for documenting insights and growth

## What's Next?

I have several exciting posts planned for the coming weeks:

- Deep dive into fine-tuning strategies for large language models
- Lessons learned from optimizing distributed training workloads
- Cost optimization techniques for ML infrastructure
- Thoughts on the future of AI development tools
- Behind-the-scenes insights from working on AWS AI services
