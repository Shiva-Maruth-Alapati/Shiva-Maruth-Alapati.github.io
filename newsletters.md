My intention for this newsletter is to serve as an quick summary of the developments in AI. 

While there might a ton of newsletters focusing on AI, but, I didn't find a good one which summarizes all the developments everyday. Furthermore, I created this for my own sanity, there are way too many developments, blogs, and research articles in this area. But, I often find my self not develling into any topic due to the sheer stress to not knowing where to start. 

This newsletter focuses on providing a brief summary of the trending topics everyday to keep me upto date. 

I'm not the one personally curating all the developments instead I created an agent which uses OpenAI, Anthropic, ArXiv, and other popular websites to find relevant data.

Any suggestion is welcome!
